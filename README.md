# Stopwatch Web Application

This is a simple web-based stopwatch application created as my second project during my Prodigy Internship. The application allows users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record lap times. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Start/Pause**: Start and pause the stopwatch.
- **Reset**: Reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
- **Lap**: Record lap times.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
